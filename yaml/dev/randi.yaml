description:
  New random numbers are generated at a given frequency between zero and a maximum upper bound.  In between random numbers, the
  value of this operation is linearly interpolated between the two numbers in time.

parameters:
- min: {
  ak-variable: lowerBound,
  comment: "Minimum range limit.",
  default: 0
}
- max: {
  ak-variable: upperBound,
  comment: "Maximum range limit.",
  default: 1
}
- cps: {
  ak-variable: frequency,
  comment: "Frequency at which the new numbers are generated in Hz.",
  default: 1
}

constants:
- seed: {
  ak-variable: seed,
  comment: "Seed to use or use the default of zero to have a random seed.",
  type: Int32,
  default: 0
