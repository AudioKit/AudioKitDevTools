summary: A set of harmonically related cosine partials.

one-word-description: partials

description:
  This is used to generate a series of partials from the harmonic series.
  It comes from the "buzz" family of Csound opcodes, and is capable of producing a
  rich spectrum of harmonic content, possibly ideal for subtractive synthesis techniques.
