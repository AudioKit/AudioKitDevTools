summary: Physical model approximating the sound of a struck metal bar.

four-letter-code:

one-word-description: strike

description:
  Audio output is a tone similar to a struck metal bar, using a physical model developed from solving the partial differential equation.
  There are controls over the boundary conditions as well as the bar characteristics.
