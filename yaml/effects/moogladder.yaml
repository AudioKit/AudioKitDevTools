  Moog Ladder is an new digital implementation of the Moog ladder filter 
  based on the work of Antti Huovilainen, described in the paper 
  "Non-Linear Digital Implementation of the Moog Ladder Filter" (Proceedings of DaFX04, Univ of Napoli).
  This implementation is probably a more accurate digital representation of the original analogue filter.

inputs:
- source: {
  ak-variable: input,
  comment: "Input audio signal."
}

parameters:
- freq: {
  ak-variable: cutoffFrequency,
  au-name: "Cutoff Frequency (Hz)",
  au-unit: Hertz,
  comment: "Filter cutoff frequency.",
  default: "1_000",
  minimum: 12.0,
  maximum: "20_000.0"
}
- res: {
  ak-variable: resonance,
  au-name: "Resonance (%)",
  au-unit: Percent,
  comment: "Resonance, generally < 1, but not limited to it. Higher than 1 resonance values might cause aliasing, analogue synths generally allow resonances to be above 1.",
  default: 0.5,
  minimum: 0.0,
  maximum: 2.0
