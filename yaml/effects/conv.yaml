one-word-description: convolution

description:
    This module will perform partitioned convolution on an input signal using
    an ftable as an impulse response.

tables:
- ft: {
  ak-variable: impulseResponseTable,
  comment: "Audio file used as the impulse response.",
  default:
}

constants:
- iPartLen: {
  ak-variable: partitionLength,
  comment: "Partition length (in samples). Must be a power of 2. Lower values will add less latency, at the cost of requiring more CPU power.",
  default: 2048
}
