summary:   A string resonator with variable fundamental frequency.

description: |
  AKStringResonator passes the input through a network composed of comb, 
  low-pass and all-pass filters, similar to the one used in some versions of the 
  Karplus-Strong algorithm, creating a string resonator effect. The fundamental frequency 
  of the “string” is controlled by the fundamentalFrequency.  
  This operation can be used to simulate sympathetic resonances to an input signal.

inputs:
- source: {
  ak-variable: input,
  comment: "Input audio signal."
}

parameters:
- freq: {
  ak-variable: fundamentalFrequency,
  comment: "Fundamental frequency of string.",
  au-name: "Fundamental Frequency (Hz)",
  au-unit: Hertz,
  default: 100,
  minimum: 12.0,
  maximum: "10_000.0"
}
- fdbgain: {
  ak-variable: feedback,
  comment: "Feedback amount (value between 0-1). A value close to 1 creates a slower decay and a more pronounced resonance. Small values may leave the input signal unaffected. Depending on the filter frequency, typical values are > .9.",
  au-name: "Feedback (%)",
  au-unit: Generic,
  default: 0.95,
  minimum: 0.0,
  maximum: 1.0
}
