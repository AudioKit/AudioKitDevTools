description:  |
  A 2nd order tunable equalization filter that provides a
  peak/notch filter for building parametric/graphic equalizers.
  With gain above 1, there will be a peak at the center frequency
  with a width dependent on bandwidth. If gain is less than 1, a notch is
  formed around the center frequency.

inputs:
- source: {
  ak-variable: input,
