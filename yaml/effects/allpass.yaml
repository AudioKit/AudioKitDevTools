description: |
  This filter reiterates the input with an echo density determined by loop time. The attenuation rate is
  independent and is determined by the reverberation time (defined as the time in seconds for a signal to
  decay to 1/1000, or 60dB down from its original amplitude).  Output will begin to appear immediately.
